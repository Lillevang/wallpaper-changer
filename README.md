## Description ‚õàÔ∏è

This Powershell script changes your desktop wallpaper based on the weather.

This is a re-implementation of https://github.com/yangman946/WallPaperChanger in pure Powershell.

## Dependencies ‚ö°

- Powershell 7.2 or newer
- Your own api key for openweather: https://openweathermap.org/api
- This api key must be in a file at: src/config/config.properties with a single line like: `app.api-key=<YOUR-API-KEY>`
  - You will be prompted for your api key the first time the application is run and the file will be created automatically

**Note:**

This version does not support the original overlay of current time, weather forecast etc. Instead an application like [Rainmeter](https://www.rainmeter.net/) can be used to achieve this effect.


## Running
- Run file from powershell or set up a scheduler to run it periodically



## Customizing Wallpapers ‚úèÔ∏è

Currently, the `Wallpaper-Changer.ps1` script supports the following weather states for both day and night:
- Clear
- Mist (cloudy)
- Rain
- thunder

You will find separate pairs of folders for each weather condition (day and night). 
These folders contain jpeg images (3936x2624 pixels) each labeled from 1 to the number of images in the folder. 
If you wish to replace images, ensure that:

- The images are of correct size (recommended 3936x2624 pixels)
- The images are in the correct folders
- The images are properly labelled {weather state}_{day state}_{image index} 
- The images are jpeg images
